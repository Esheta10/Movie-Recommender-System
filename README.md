## üß† How It Works

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Movie metadata is preprocessed and stored in pickle files.
   - Important features like genres, cast, and directors are combined for similarity computation.

2. **Recommendation Generation**:
   - Movies are vectorized, and cosine similarity is used to compute pairwise similarities.
   - The top 5 similar movies are recommended for the selected input.

3. **TMDB API Integration**:
   - Movie posters are dynamically fetched using TMDB API endpoints.

4. **Popular Movies**:
   - A separate section lists popular movies with additional details.
